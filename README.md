Student Grades Analysis

This Java program allows users to input grades for a specified number of students, validates the input to ensure it falls within the range of 0 to 100, and calculates and displays the highest score, lowest score, and average score. The program is structured with input validation to prompt users for correct input until a valid grade is provided for each student.
